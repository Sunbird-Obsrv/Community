# Introduction

Obsrv was conceived and incubated within the open-source initiative [Sunbird](https://sunbird.org/) in 2016. Obsrv is built to operate with highest levels of reliability with bare minimum operations effort at scale.

One of the early and significant applications of Obsrv is within DIKSHA, the national platform for schools and teachers in India. In the DIKSHA environment, Obsrv handled data volumes ranging from a few million events per day to 2 billion events per day at peak. The current average volume is 500 million events per day and the system has not experienced any downtime in the past 2 years.

This microsite provides a comprehensive overview and guides to understand and use Obsrv for various data use cases.
