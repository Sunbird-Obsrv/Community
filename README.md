# Welcome to Obsrv

Obsrv was conceived and incubated within the open-source initiative [Sunbird](https://sunbird.org/) in 2016. Obsrv is built to operate with highest levels of reliability with bare minimum operations effort at scale.

One of the early and significant applications of Obsrv is within **DIKSHA**, the national platform for schools and teachers in India. In the DIKSHA environment, Obsrv handled data volumes ranging from a few million events per day to **2 billion events per day** at peak. The current average volume is 500 million events per day and the system has not experienced any downtime in the past 2 years.

This microsite provides a comprehensive overview and guides to understand and use Obsrv for various data use cases.
