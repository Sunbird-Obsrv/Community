description: Challenges in implementing and managing a robust Data Value Chain

# Challenges

Despite the availability of numerous scalable and dependable technologies in the data space, the combination of these technologies often results in a fragile end solution. Only select big-tech companies have successfully mastered the processes of generating, consuming, and utilizing data reliably at any scaleâ€”examples include Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and LinkedIn. The existence of reliable data platforms facilitating a robust Data Value Chain has served as a significant distinguishing factor for these companies. And none of these companies have shared their end-to-end solutions with others, only a handful have released some of the tools they internally use, such as Facebook's contribution with Cassandra.&#x20;

> ### _<mark style="color:blue;">A pressing issue for many organizations is the substantial effort required to develop, operate or maintain an end-to-end data solution reliably.</mark>_

The challenge of reliably managing the data value chain is growing for numerous companies, particularly as contemporary products generate substantial data volumes, even with a relatively modest user base.

### Key Challenges

The challenges faced by most of the organizations in operating a data value chain mainly falls into one of the following four categories:

1. **Time**: Significant amount of time mis-spent in managing the solution rather than in leveraging data's full potential
2. **Cost**: High upfront CapEx and running costs
3. **Capability**: Challenges to build, manage and operate complex data technologies & systems
4. **Risk**: Business & technical risks due to propietary & fragmented solutions, rigid & less reliable systems

Listed below are some challenges that are often faced by organizations with data platforms & solutions:

* Comprehensive, ready-to-use solutions for implementing the entire data value-chain are scarce. In many instances, organizations resort to employing extensive teams of Data and DevOps engineers to build these solutions.
* Data Analysts consistently grapple with challenges related to data integrity, quality, and accessibility, primarily due to the dynamic and evolving nature of data.
* Data Engineers spend substantial time resolving reliability issues due to the agile nature of data and interoperability challenges between components of data platforms.
* Inherent complexities of data platforms, when exposed, increase timelines for new pipeline creation, increasing the lead times for generating data insights.
* Organizations find themselves compelled to transition to a new data solution as they grow and have diverse data use-cases.
* Majority of existing managed solutions, if not all, bind users to proprietary data tools and formats, creating a vendor lock-in.
